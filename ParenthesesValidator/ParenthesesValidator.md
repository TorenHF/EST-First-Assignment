# Testing results

---
code seems fine, nothing added (well, I added an explanation to the start of the file, but that was mostly for my own convenience), all tests passed.
Tested for:
- all pairs individually
- random nested combinations
- consecutive pairs
- wrong cases (mismatches)
- just opened parentheses
- only closed parentheses
- empty sting
